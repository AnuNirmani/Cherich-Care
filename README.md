# CherichCare


## Overview

CherishCare is a newly innovated app, focusing on finding digital health solutions towards the problem of increasing breast cancer as well as raising breast health awareness. Through, we could argue that the developments in the health care sector are enough. On this matter, we cannot be certain of the escalations of these developments as most of the highest quality services reach only a handful of countries. As a result, some women in certain areas such as African region and South Asian regions battle with having better health care and even common knowledge on these matters. Therefore, CherishCare becomes more and more helpful as it operates as a selfguide to women who struggle with receiving good healthcare. However, this is not just a vision solely accustomed to above mentioned groups. This is a vision aimed at encouraging women globally by providing services that make self-monitoring simple, accurate and more accessible. By the usage of new technologies, CherishCare orients itself with the SDGs to spread awareness of good health and well-being, gender equality and reduced healthcare breaches and discrepancy/ disparity. This can be easily recognized as a step towards counseling gaps in women healthcare through much needed education, empowerment and technologies
